* If you'd like to tinker with the colors of your app, try using HEX codes from [HTML Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/).
* The `assets` folder contains a file called `favicon.ico` -- you can find and download customized favicons [here](https://www.favicon.cc/). Just replace the current favicon with a new one.
